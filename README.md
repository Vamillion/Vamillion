# Hello everybody 👋

welcome at my own repository for some coding.

By now, it's quite empty here I know, but I will focus on starting a few projects in the near future.
Maybe you find something interesting in here soon.

## About myself:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few things for my own:

1. Updating my programming skills
2. Get in touch with maschine, federated & deep learning aspects
3. Start learning Android development
4. etc.

- 🌱 I’m currently focus on learning Kotlin, Python and by time a bit Java Script too.
- 💡 My first programming language is Java so if you know someone who know's .... leave a hint 😉.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects in Java / Kotlin and for feedback in any possible situations!

## Interesting topics I like to work on 

* Neuroimaging 🤩
* Maschine, federated & deep learning stuff 🤩
* Projects on cancer ❤️
* Nearly everything which could have an inpact in health ❤️💝


## What should you do if you read this?

Maybe you find something interesting in hear or see something strange, feel free to copy from or raise an issue to discuss.
If you have some interesting ideas, please raise an issue or invite me on a project.


## For the neuroimaging scientists

The science sector of neuroimaging is a huge field with little to non structure in data organizations (maybe not so bad but still).
Please, if you won't to work on reproducable studies in neuroimaging have a look at [this](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) if you not already know! 

A good friend of mine worked on a solution to get the BIDS structure into your dataset.
It's a tool written in R with high data throughput.
Maybe you want to have a closer look on [this](https://github.com/wulms/BiDirect_BIDS_Converter)?
